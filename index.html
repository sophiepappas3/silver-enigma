        <p>fear is the mind killer. fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. i will face my fear. i will
            permit it to pass over me and through me. and when it has gone past, i will turn the inner eye to see its
            path. where the fear has gone there will be nothing. only i will remain.

        It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.
